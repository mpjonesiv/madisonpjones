									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<br><h3><em>About the North Woods Project</em></h3>
								</header>
                                <h4>Project Description</h4>
								<p>
                                    This webtext documents an emerging series of digital interventions and exhibits situated with/in the North Woods, an approximately 300-acre parcel of unmanaged forests and wetlands on the northern part of the University of Rhode Island’s campus. <em>North Woods Project</em> (or NWP) is an evolving, open-access digital resource developed by the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/dwell/">DWELL Lab at URI</a> that combines augmented reality (AR), web development, and digital mapping (GIS) with hands-on experiential learning, rhetorical field methods, and creative-critical approaches to science and environmental storytelling. NWP brings together artistic and scientific perspectives through a rotating series of interactive interventions, including walking tours, trash cleanups, ecological data collection, art and poetry workshops, and digital storytelling.

                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    As part of our ongoing work, the team participated in the 2024 North Woods BioBlitz, leading workshops on different approaches to taking field notes, artistic practices like texture rubbings, and the relationship between creative writing and natural science. We also released the first series of Points of Interest (or POIs) on our digital walking tour, using a combination of GIS and AR to provide participants with both locative and remote options to interact with our content.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    At the same time, we hope to demonstrate more broadly how digital technologies and creative methods can come together to foster different forms of remote access to field-based experiences, extending the North Woods beyond their physical borders and opening them up to new audiences and participants. These methods provide important opportunities for researchers to contribute to more accessible experiences in a wide range of contexts, which members of our team discuss at greater length in a separate study (Heilig, et al., 2024). The theories and methods we discuss could be similarly applied to a wide range of contexts beyond a “natural” site, including other parts of campus or in the wider community.

									<h2>Digital Field Methods and Locative Media</h2>
                                </header>
								<h3>The <em>North Woods Project</em> (NWP)</h3>
									<p>
                                        NWP takes a field-based approach to pedagogy that uses augmented reality and other mobile technologies to bridge the gap between the sciences and humanities in order to foster more engaging digital and analog experiences with place. Students and educators collaborate to practice rhetorical field methods and art-based research, using multimodal tools and deep-mapping techniques to encourage participatory methods through entertaining and engaging exhibitions. Emerging science communication techniques require an exploration of spatial rhetoric and digital literacy that foster inclusive locations of equitable knowledge sharing and development. The NWP explores existing practices and concepts that have been examined as a means to evolve these communication models.

								<h3>Creative-Critical Electrate Fieldwork</h3>
                                    <p>
                                       In this project we engage with what Gregory L. Ulmer terms <em>electracy</em>, which can be described as the apparatus shift characterized by the transition from print to electronic media, with broad implications for culture and society (Ulmer, 2003). As the fractured response to the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare, traditional approaches to science and environmental communication are not well equipped to address the large-scale social and environmental challenges we face. Instead, NWP applies an electrate model for science communication by implementing digital and rhetorical field methods in artistic installations which are designed as entertainment-based forms of science communication, inspired by Ulmer’s longstanding collaboration with the Florida Research Ensemble composed of artists and theorists (Ulmer et al., 2022). Electracy reveals the importance of entertainment as a form of communication in any capacity (Markelj, et al., 2023). With complex, multi-genre content, creating projects that engage users opens up new ways of sharing information and knowledge that has historically been regarded as inaccessible or irrelevant. Our approach blends together creative and critical modes with artistic and scientific perspectives for environmental storytelling. In doing so, we extend Ulmer’s creative-critical writing practices (1985) and his engagements with post-criticism, art, and creativity (1983). In many ways, our approach to NWP as an emerging platform for storytelling is based on his work with collage/montage that seeks to make and compose rather than critique.
                                    </p>

									<p>
                                       Introducing rhetorical perspectives to field methods and participatory research is a way to challenge current practices and assumptions about ethics and rhetorical research. Some of the key ethics examined through rhetorical field methods regard text, context, the critic, the rhetor and audiences (Chevrette et. al., 2023). The goal is to explore different pedagogical approaches which foster new perspectives and anti-colonial methods.  NWP implements this methodology by using participatory perspectives to examine topics such as environmental science, ethnography, history and literature. One way to accomplish this is through using art as a means to convey different topics and reveal knowledge. Digital field methods are implemented as a way to create digital media and artwork which can shape collaborative fieldwork and create “spaces for a wider number of voices and stories” and “intervene in unsustainable and unjust patterns” (McGreavy, 2023). Creating an exhibition of these artifacts is a method of research which encourages creative expression and inquiry into new or existing concepts.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    This methodology combines existing concepts of art-based research (ABR) and exhibition-based research (EBR). The purpose of art-based research is to explore the connective tissue between visual art and writing. Kristin LaFollette explores the concept of ‘transgenre composing,’ or the intersecting of visual art and writing” (LaFollette, 2022). She believes that transgenre composing can encourage a pedagogical system where embodiment of ideas is celebrated and can create a more tangible feeling to learning and education (LaFollette, 2022). Similarly, EBR is a way to distill complex research concepts by curating multimodal research artifacts into an exhibition-styled format (Eccles et. al., 2024). The authors explain that this “approach creates a dynamic engagement between the public, academia, and creatives, increasing the relevancy of findings across audiences and advancing public understandings” (Eccles et. al., 2024). NWP extends work in ABR/EBR to create a distinctive style of learning that is accessible to large communities beyond the primary audience for its topic. It is an example of rhetorical field methods by challenging the streamlined learning models that can be restrictive and discourage creative processes.

									<h3>Deep Mapping and Critical Cartography</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    The digital and analog artifacts developed by the NWP accumulate to a landscape of public memory and meaning-making in the form of a multi-layered mesh of deep-mapping techniques. Using location-based technologies, deep-mapping shapes our approach to digital-field methods by sustaining a growing collection of artifacts specifically tied to places. Through this method we can practice critical cartography by including participatory design, which expands upon new and existing narratives about space and place from a diverse range of perspectives and knowledge. April O’Brien offers a similar method/ology in her work with countermapping (O’Brien, 2024) based on Ulmer’s work with electrate choragraphy (O’Brien, 2020). As such, we build from this work to demonstrate how methods from critical cartography can be used for pedagogy in concert with digital environmental communication projects to richly layer information and deepen engagement with places. 
                                    </p>

									<p>
                                       Deep mapping is an important method that informs our approach to digital field methods using location-based technologies. As a method for critical cartography, deep mapping combines a diverse range of perspectives, histories, knowledges, and experiences in order to create meaningful narratives about a place. This project extends previous work that applied deep mapping techniques to environmental storytelling (Butts and Jones, 2021). Through practices like bodystorming (Milligan, N.D.), localization (Jones, N.D.) and participatory design (Weaver, 2022), we demonstrate how designers can use spatial techniques to craft compelling stories about places and to make connections with the communities, histories, and cultures that compose them. Using creative and place-based methods in concert with locative media allows designers to engage communities in participatory projects on pressing social and environmental issues, creating platforms for active participation in spatial storytelling.

                                    <h3>Place-based Field Notes Workshop</h3>
									<p>
                                        On April 27 and 28, 2024, the second annual BioBlitz took place in the North Woods on the University of Rhode Island campus. To open the weekend, I led a workshop about field notes. Often used in ecological science, ethnographic research, and narrative writing, field notes are a practice that varies from formal to freeform, depending on the style and goals of each individual.

                                       Learning to take field notes is a process of study, participation, and exploration. When I lead field notes workshops, I come from a place of reflection and invitation. I typically share examples of my field notes and journals that showcase different methods and approaches. I find that passing around the physical copies has an effect of immersion, encouraging participants to engage deeper with the stories I share. While sharing these pieces of my past, I encourage participants to view field notes as a piece of personal history, a “gift to their future selves”, rather than a burden of documentation.

                                       For the North Woods BioBlitz, I brought several examples from my undergraduate studies, as well as my notebook for the North Woods. Each set is different, depending on the nature of the project. For a field crew in the Hassayampa River Wilderness, my goal was recording the progress and methods of riparian restoration on the Hassayampa River. My set of Grinnellian journals has detailed records of natural history and ecology from different islands in the Gulf of California and mainland Sonora, Mexico, from a semester at the Prescott College Kino Bay Field Station. My North Woods notes contain jottings of different visits with professors, classmates, and solo explorations, wandering and generating ideas. 
                                    </p>
                                    
									<h3>Grinnellian Field Notes</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        There are times when rigid, formal notes are useful, such as with Grinnellian Journaling. In the Grinnellian tradition, there are strict guidelines for formatting and contents of field journals. The main components are a field notebook, used for quick jottings; a journal of narrative transcriptions that expands on said jottings; and species accounts. Grinnellian field notes are formalized in a way that makes them a powerful piece of scientific recording in the ecological sciences. 
                                    </p>

									<h3>Ethnographic Field Notes</h3>
								
                                    <p>
                                       Ethnographic field notes are used for researchers to understand and analyze the nuances of social interactions and situations. Kelly E. Tenzek (2017) writes “it is imperative for the researcher to pay attention to the physical space, location, people, interactions, and what is not being said”. Tenzek also discusses differences between descriptive and reflective field notes, writing that descriptive notes “can be thought of as the tangible, physical, objective interpretation of what was going on”, while “reflective field notes are more subjective in nature and create the space for the ethnographer to tap into [their] own personal interpretation of the observations”. In my experience, these approaches are best used in harmony together.
                                    </p>
								
									<h3>Interdisciplinary Field Notes</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        In both ethnography and ecology, field notes have the potential to add richness and depth to observations, or serve as standalone data. Both traditions recommend transcribing and expanding notes into longer journals after the field visit. This allows the writer to strengthen the entries with qualitative information, clarifying and organizing them into a succinct recollection of the day. It can also be a place of reflection, and adding probing questions.
                                    </p>
								
								
									<p>
										Field notes themselves are interdisciplinary. As part of American scientific traditions, they have long participated in the connections between arts and science, dating back to the combined field notes, illustrations, and deep mapping practices of William Bartram and before (Butts and Jones, 2021; Sivils, 2004).

										There are many pieces of influential writing, as well as lesser-known works, that draw on field notes or consist directly of field journals. Natural history has been crafted by field notes which influence our understanding of modern science. Florence R. Krall (1994) was one of the first to use field notes to blend scholarship and creative writing in her book <em>Ecotone: Wayfaring on the Margins</em>. Her groundbreaking work is an inspiration not only to this project but to many in the environmental writing tradition, including her student Terry Tempest Williams. In <em>Finding Beauty in a Broken World</em>, Williams (2008) included almost 200 pages of field notes about prairie dog observations, interspersed with anecdotes from personal and natural histories. In both works, field notes serve as both scientific record and personal inspiration.

									<h3>Five Best Practices for Field Notes:</h3>
								
									<ol>
  										<li>Always begin entries with context. For all styles, it’s prudent to include the date, location, activity, and others who are present.</li>
  										<li>Know your purpose and goals. Are you recording environmental conditions? Learning about social interactions? Gathering inspiration for writing and artistic projects?</li>
  										<li>Record subjective and objective information. Include your impressions of the place or scene, even if they seem insignificant. They may help to understand the broader picture later.</li>
 										<li>Transcribe field notes/jottings into longer journal entries, with narrative descriptions. This should be done as soon as possible. Immediately after the field visit, or at least on the same day, is ideal.</li>
 										<li>Develop your own methods and style. Traditional systems such as ethnography or Grinnell can be a helpful starting point. From there, find ways to make the practice enjoyable and meaningful.</li>
									</ol>
								
									<h3>Field Notes in Practice</h3>
									<p>
										Sometimes, adherence to strict traditions can be intimidating. I place emphasis on personal methodology, “finding your (field) voice”, and using tools that craft an enjoyable and meaningful practice. On the day of the workshop, we distributed small, pocket-size notebooks and pencils with erasers, but also discussed how digital field notes can be extremely effective, either standalone or complementary with written field notes. Photos, video, voice memos, voice to text, and typing are ways to make field notes more dynamic and appealing.

									<p>
										We encouraged participants to gather inspiration for the Renga poetry workshop later in the day, as well as their scientific observations for the BioBlitz. Through a combination of scientific and creative activities, students were able to immerse themselves in the North Woods and explore the ways in which field notes have the potential to deepen engagement with, and immersion in, our university forest.

                                    <h3>(Conclusion)</h3>
									<p>
                                        Detroit’s city-wide lack of consistent internet coverage is part of the disparities that global-scale infrastructures place on marginalized residents. Citing a Federal Communications Commission report, a Motherboard article from 2017 points out that, in Detroit, “40 percent of the population has no access to the internet [...] of any kind” (Rogers). In the face of this lack of access, organizations like the <a href="https://alliedmedia.org/dctp" target="_blank">Detroit Community Technology Project</a> are developing “local and international community wireless mesh networks” for underserved communities and training members of the community “to build and maintain their own wireless communications infrastructure” (“Detroit Community Technology”). Organizations like DCTP demonstrate how digital networks might be further rooted in local communities rather than relying on global Telecom companies. These grassroots movements are interfacing with large-scale economic disparity through community networks.

                                        As discussed throughout this webtext, Detroit has been made to stand in for many different economic and geographical ways of thinking in the national imagination, a mirror through which the country can see itself. The city is often read as a place on the verge of utopia or dystopia, as nearly ruined or reborn. In this way, Detroit is rhetorically constructed as what Michel Foucault terms a “heterotopia.” In his 1967 essay “Of Other Spaces” Foucault defines the concept in relation to the function of utopic and dystopic places:

									</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        The mirror is, after all, a utopia, since it is a placeless place. In the mirror, I see myself there where I am not, in an unreal, virtual space that opens up behind the surface; I am over there, there where I am not, a sort of shadow that gives my own visibility to myself, that enables me to see myself there where I am absent: such is the utopia of the mirror. But it is also a heterotopia in so far as the mirror does exist in reality, where it exerts a sort of counteraction on the position that I occupy. From the standpoint of the mirror I discover my absence from the place where I am since I see myself over there.
									</blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        Detroit’s local economy is often thought of as a synecdoche, or stand-in for the entire United States, a mirror for the country to see itself, as it was during the 2008 financial crisis. Yet, Detroit persists as a place beyond these topological ways of defining the city. As a place, Detroit defies the metaphors of growth and decline, offering instead examples of resilience and resistance. This project engages Detroit as a choric and emergent space defined by the complex relations of its inhabitants. The “Articulate Detroit” project uses augmented reality to amplify these aims, seeking rather than to define the city, to unearth the network. Through AR, participants move through the looking glass of Detroit as a heterotopia, interfacing between networks of the digital and material environment.

                                        In this project, we described a locative media walking tour that took place as part of ASLE’s “Rust/Resistance” conference. The conference theme drew upon Detroit’s histories of “rust, resistance, and recovery”:
									</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        Long associated with steel, car culture, and the music of Motown, Detroit is also a site of struggle for racial and environmental justice, against depopulation and ‘ruin porn,’ and for the preservation of artistic heritage. A nexus of encounters between indigenous nations and the French fur trade, it became a locus of the Great Migration, “white flight,” and gentrification. Water-rich on the strait between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, Detroit and its neighbors struggle against corroded infrastructure and government corruption (ASLE, “Rust”). 
									</blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        The “Articulate Detroit” project works to visualize the convergence of sedimented histories and contemporary disparities within the context of grassroots community resistance. As writing studies scholarship increasingly connects with public audiences and local spaces, projects like this one seek to engage and amplify community networks, rather than render those networks a static topology through definition. 

									</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Between completing the tour and this webtext, Aurasma (the AR software used to create the project) was purchased by Hewlett Packard, rebranded as HP-Reveal, and then promptly discontinued. Although we were able to preserve the spirit of the tour in the Google map on the previous page, this incident is emblematic of the ongoing corporatization of augmented space. Indeed, companies from Facebook to Apple are investing heavily in AR technologies in the hopes of becoming the “universal AR browser” for all locative media experiences. As the borders between digital and physical worlds continue to erode, it is vital that writing and rhetoric scholars not only continue to interrogate the rhetorical implications of this new computing paradigm but actively work to create more sustainable and inclusive digital platforms for creating and accessing AR content. To this end, researchers working with the Trace Initiative are currently pursuing possibilities for creating a humanities-based AR platform designed exclusively for public humanities projects.
