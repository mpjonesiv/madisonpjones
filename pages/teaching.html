                    <h3>Professional Communication</h3>
                    <p>Professional communication is the study and practice of relaying technical information to a variety of audiences, including public, civic, academic, and workplace. This course provides instruction and practice in professional communication, focusing on clarity, design, and inventive techniques which are useful across professional writing environments. This course will model traditional professional documents, such as reports, letters, memos, and evaluations, which are part of everyday acts of professional communication, as well as professional job documents like resumes and cover letters. By analyzing writing situations, students develop skills for communicating across professional writing environments. This course introduces you to adaptive practices and genres of writing which will serve writers throughout their careers, including in academia and industry. </p>
                    
                    <p>Professional communication denotes a wide range of information exchanges which take place across <b>fields</b> (such as a scientist communicating with the public), <b>organizations</b> (such as a business advertising to a target audience), and <b>modalities</b> (such as a potential client interacting with a professional website). Professional communication is broad field of communication studies which includes subfields like technical writing, public writing, and business writing. While technical writing focuses on communicating in field-specific genres, professional writing is characterized by a focus on clarity, accessibility, and design for broad workplace audiences. The final section of this course will be devoted to the role of digital media in professional communication, focusing on podcasting, social media, and web design. Increasingly, government agencies and private institutions are utilizing multimodal writing genres to connect with audiences online. Through reports, proposals, usability testing, and a presentation, students will learn about user experience design and multimodal writing in professional communication. </p>

                    <h3>Advanced Exposition: Digital Rhetoric</h3>
                    <p>Rhetorically, expository writing links to the Ancient Greek practice of ekphrasis, where writers sought to elucidate through the art of depiction. At that time, writing was a newly evolving technology, and it posed distinct problems and possibilities for rhetoricians. Similarly, the advent of digital networks calls into question the ways we define writing and rhetoric today. Mobile and wearable technologies present discrete opportunities and obstacles to distinctions of digital and non-digital spaces. With this ontological shift in mind, this course focuses on digital exposition as a rhetorical act. Through the tradition of exposition, students will define the exigencies facing writers in contemporary media environments by discussing and making digital texts.</p>
                        
                    <p>Etymologically, exposition has roots in expōnĕre—meaning not only to explain and interpret but also to exhibit and display. Readings will challenge students to consider how digital publishing changes research, composition, and circulation of scholarship. Assignments follow a projectbased learning model. Students will track, collect, and visualize data on the circulation of digital artifacts; use emerging technologies and tools for composition; and describe the impacts that digital technologies have on the rhetorical acts of exposition.</p>
