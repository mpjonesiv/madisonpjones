                    <p>The <strong>Digital Writing Environments, Location, &amp; Localization Lab</strong> investigates how location-based media are changing the ways that writers and readers interact with place. Projects in the lab focus on the use of mobile, locative, and wearable technologies for community-engaged science communication, social justice, and environmental advocacy. This lab works at the nexus of science and technical/professional writing, rhetorical field methods, and digital production to create experiential learning initiatives in support of the local community. Through a foundation in the study of rhetoric, we combine spatial theories, user-localization, and place-based methods with emerging technologies to build platforms that foster equitable knowledge-production within communities.

                    <p>EcoTour is a downloadable smartphone application that allows state park visitors to access information about the human-caused environmental threats facing Paynes Prairie as well as undocumented histories of the park. Through a multimodal research and writing assignment in three different writing courses, students produced the content for the application. Similar to an audio walking tour, the app allows users to walk through the La Chua trail and learn more about the ecological diversity and environmental threats within the preservation area. EcoTour provides access to a large repository of information using technology that many visitors already have in their pocket. This project was funded by a Bob Grahm Center Healthy Civic Campus &amp; Community Grant from the University of Florida.

                    <p>
                        Through a place-based case study of ghost bicycles, this article examines the digital and material rhetorics used by cycling advocates in Jacksonville, Florida. Ghost bikes are repurposed bicycles put in places where cyclists have been fatally injured. These monuments function as memorials, public acknowledgement of the unspoken costs of car-centered cultural values. However, ghost bikes are temporary monuments. They are often stolen or taken down by authorities within just a few days or weeks of installation. As part of this project, we created a mobile AR experience to digitally visualize ghost bikes in the places where they have been removed. Published in <em>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy</em>, Fall 2017, vol. 22, no. 1.

                    <p>
                        A location-based digital writing project exhibited at the 2017 Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment (ASLE, 2017) conference held in Detroit, Michigan, funded through a grant from the conference organizers. The project offers a generative model for how mobile technologies might be employed within writing studies scholarship and in public humanities contexts more broadly. This project uses free mobile application software to generate augmented reality displays at eighteen locations along Detroit’s iconic Woodward Avenue.

                    <h3>An AR App for the UF Campus and Gainesville Community</h3>
                    <p>
                       A student-led project, conducted in collaboration with the Sustainaibility Studies program at the Unviersity of Florida and the Trace Innovation Initiative. I assisted two students in developing an augmented reality tour of UF's campus focusing on sustainability and the community. The project was part of a Sustainability Studies course and served as part of their Green Gator Graduation Chord requirement. Presently, this project is being expanded as a class assignment with the ultimate goal of creating a campus-wide project. This project was funded through support from a Creative Campus Catalyst Fund Grant at UF.
