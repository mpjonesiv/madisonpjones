				        <img src="../images/avatar3.webp" class="left" alt="Jones headshot photo" />
				        I am an associate professor of science communication, jointly appointed in the departments of Professional &amp; Public Writing and Natural Resources Science at the University of Rhode Island, where I am a Senior Fellow at the Coastal Institute, coordinate the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/cels/academics/graduate-programs/certificate-in-science-writing-and-rhetoric/" target="_blank">Graduate Certificate in Science Writing and Rhetoric</a>, and direct the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/dwell/" target="_blank">DWELL Lab</a>. I research the rhetoric of science and technology (RST) through social and historical perspectives, teach courses on science writing and environmental justice, and practice community-engagement with science using location-based technologies (e.g.â€”augmented reality and digital maps) as well as creative and digital/visual approaches to science and environmental communication. My <a href="research.html">research</a> intersects place-based writing and digital rhetoric to understand how emerging media provide new possibilities for environmental advocacy and science storytelling. My lab has received support from a wide range of organizations, from the National Science Foundation to the National Endowment for the Humanities, to the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, to The National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

                   In May 2020, I received a Ph.D. in English from the University of Florida, with a specialization in Rhetoric &amp; Writing Studies, where I was awarded a Preeminence Fellowship and a Doctoral Dissertation Award. My scholarly articles have appeared in journals such as <em>Enculturation</em>, <em>Rhetoric Society Quarterly</em>, and <em>Kairos</em>, and they have been recognized by CCCC/NCTE's 2020 Best Article on Philosophy or Theory of Technical or Scientific Communication, Honorable Mention for the 2022 ARSTM Article of the Year Award, and CCCC/NCTE's 2022 Best Article on Pedagogy or Curriculum in Technical or Scientific Communication. I am co-editor of <em>Rhetorical Ecologies</em> (NCTE, 2024) and <em>Writing the Environment in Nineteenth-Century American Literature: The Ecological Awareness of Early Scribes of Nature</em> (Bloomsbury, 2015). I am presently completing my first scholarly monograph, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9783031987922" target="_blank"><em>Inventing Ecosystems: The Rhetoric of Science in an Ecological Age</em></a>(Palgrave, 2025), examining the shared conceptual histories of ecosystems and rhetorical ecologies.
