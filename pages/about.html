                    <p>
				        <img src="../images/avatar.jpg" class="left" alt="Jones headshot photo" />
				        I am an assistant professor in the departments of Writing &amp; Rhetoric and Natural Resources Science at the University of Rhode Island where I am a Senior Fellow at the Coastal Institute and direct the <a href="dwell.html">DWELL Lab</a>. I research the rhetoric of science through social and historical perspectives, teach courses on science writing and environmental advocacy, and practice community-engagement with science using location-based technologies (e.g.â€”augmented reality and StoryMaps) as well as creative and digital/visual approaches to science and environmental communication. My <a href="research.html">research</a> intersects place-based writing and digital rhetoric to understand how locative media provide new possibilities for environmental advocacy and science storytelling. As part of my place-based research, I am interested in using rhetorical historiography as part of the social justice paradigm shift for environmental communication. My research has received support from a wide range of organizations, from the National Endowment for the Humanities, to the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, to The National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

                   In May 2020, I received a Ph.D. in English from the University of Florida, where I specialized in Rhetoric and Writing Studies and was awarded the Fall 2019 Graduate School Doctoral Dissertation Award. My scholarly articles have appeared in <em>Enculturation</em>, <em>Rhetoric Society Quarterly</em>, <em>Kairos</em>, and elsewhere. My article on "Sylvan Rhetorics" in <em>Rhetoric Review</em> was awarded the NCTE/CCCC 2020 Best Article on Philosophy or Theory of Technical or Scientific Communication, my article on "A Counterhistory of Rhetorical Ecologies" in <em>Rhetoric Society Quarterly</em> was given Honorable Mention for the ARSTM Article of the Year Award, and my co-authored article on "Deep Mapping for Environmental Communication Design" in <em>Communication Design Quarterly</em> was awarded the NCTE/CCCC 2022 Best Article on Pedagogy or Curriculum in Technical or Scientific Communication. I co-edited <em>Writing the Environment in Nineteenth-Century American Literature: The Ecological Awareness of Early Scribes of Nature</em> (Lexington Books, 2015).

                     In addition to my scholarship and creative writing, I apply my research to develop <a href="grants.html">grant-funded digital projects</a> for public advocacy and to provide high-impact experiences for my science and environmental writing courses.
